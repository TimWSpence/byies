# Build your own effect system

This is a course designed to help you build an effect system in Scala that is similar to [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/). The intention is that by building it yourself you should gain a deeper understanding of how an `IO` action is evaluated and the impact of things like blocking, timers, async execution on the performance of your application.

## How to use

The course is divided into chapters which should iteratively build on top of each other. Each chapter has its own git branch. The goal of that chapter will be described in the corresponding `README.md`. If you get stuck then you can consult `hints.md` for some guidance. If you're really stuck then you can look at the source code, which is a possible solution for that chapter.
